"""1. Escape Sequences
Escape sequences are special character combinations in strings that let you insert things you canâ€™t easily type or that have special meaning.

Common ones:

Escape Sequence	Meaning
\n	New line
\t	Tab space
\\	Backslash itself
\'	Single quote
\"	Double quote
\b	Backspace
\r	Carriage return (cursor to start of line)

# Example:
print("Hello\nWorld")  # Line break
print("Tab\tSpace")    # Tab between words
print("She said: \"Hi\"")  # Quotes inside quotes
